## 🚀 QUICKEST START

### Option 1: Just Double-Click (Recommended!)
```
1. Go to: c:\Users\HP\Py
2. Double-click: START.bat
3. Terminal opens and starts server
4. Browser opens to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
5. Login with: admin / admin
```

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
cd c:\Users\HP\Py
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Option 3: PowerShell
```powershell
cd c:\Users\HP\Py

```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before you run the app, verify everything:

### Quick Check
```bash
python verify_system.py
```

This will check:
- ✓ Python version
- ✓ Required files
- ✓ Dependencies installed
- ✓ Database
- ✓ Network (port not in use)

### Manual Check
```
□ app.py - exists in c:\Users\HP\Py
□ templates/index.html - exists
□ requirements.txt - exists
□ store_inventory.db - exists (your data)
□ Python 3.8+ installed
```

---

## 📋 INSTALLATION STEPS

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd c:\Users\HP\Py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Wait for: `Successfully installed Flask Flask-CORS Werkzeug`

### Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
python verify_system.py
```

You should see: `✓ All systems ready!`

### Step 3: Start Server
**Windows:**
- Double-click `START.bat`

**Or manually:**
```bash
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Press CTRL+C to quit
```

### Step 4: Open Browser
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 5: Login
```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

## 🎯 FIRST TIME SETUP

### With Existing Data (Recommended)
Your old database will be automatically used:
1. Run `python app.py`
2. Your products are there
3. Start using immediately

### With Sample Data
```bash
python load_sample_data.py
python app.py
```

This loads 15 test products so you can explore features safely.

### Fresh Start (Wipe Everything)
```bash
del store_inventory.db
python app.py
```

A new empty database will be created.

---

## 💾 YOUR DATA IS SAFE

✅ All your previous inventory data is preserved
✅ Every product is where it was before
✅ All images are intact
✅ User accounts unchanged
✅ Sales history retained

The new web app uses the EXACT same `store_inventory.db` file!

## 🌐 ACCESSING THE APPLICATION

### On Your Computer
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
http://localhost:5000
